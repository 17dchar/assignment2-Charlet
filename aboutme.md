I'm a computer science major. I'm currently taking a Web Apps and Services class 
and this repo is an assignment for that class. I'm kind of confused why we are doing
these example repos in a 500 level class though. You would think we would get straight 
into the hard stuff. I don't mind anyway, it just seems odd.
